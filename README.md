# CodeDesigner

This project is a fork of the fabulous CodeDesigner, made by MichalBlitznak, you can find the original one here: https://github.com/MichalBliznak/CodeDesigner
We fork is to make some changes to allow CodeDesigner to behave slightly different than the original one.
Our intention is to generate pull requests to the original project as soon as we add any feature that could be interesting for other people.

The original information of the project is here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/codedesigner/

Thanks Michal for such great project!
